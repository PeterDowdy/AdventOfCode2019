# Advent Of Code 2019

I'm doing this one in Python to get a better grasp of the language basics.

## Day 1

Simple as this one was, thus did I find out that Python defaults to floating point division, even when dividing integers.

## Day 2

Fantasy computers! Always fun. I couldn't think of a way to solve this without brute-forcing the second half, though.

## Day 3

This one was pretty straight-forward. I was impressed by the ability to logical and two Sets to get an intersection.

## Day 4

This code was really hacky, but that's what you get when you tell me I get to constrain the length of my search as well as only worry about positive integer numbers.

## Day 5

More fantasy computer. This was just elaborating the computer and wasn't too tricky.

## Day 6

Tree traversal. Building the tree is so amazingly concise in Python. I thought I might need to build a spanning tree for the second part until I realized I could find the closest overlapping node between two trees from the origin.

## Day 7

More fantasy computer. Adding pipes was a neat concept.

## Day 8

Displaying this as black on white (and illegible to me) instead of white on black slowed me down way more than it ought to.

## Day 9

Yet more fantasy computer. I got it into my head that input and output address modes could / should be handled by the same function and this was wrong.

## Day 10

This one threw me for a while. I was on the right track using division to find out if two points shared a slope relative to another point, and therefore a line. What I was not so lucky about was that if the denominator of a fraction is negative, Python turns the numerator negative instead.

## Day 11

More and more fantasy computer! This one was neat, but I got hung up far too long on the second part for not realizing that I was specifying the starting square in two separate spots.
